## What Challenges Did I Face Installing Android Studio

The main challenge I faced was during the building process — it often stopped or canceled unexpectedly. I also had trouble finding a proper medium to display and run the project smoothly. Setting up the emulator and connecting it to my device took some trial and error before everything worked correctly.

## What I Learned About Android App Structure

I learned how to navigate Android Studio and understand how the app files are organized, such as the Java, res, and manifest folders. It was nice discovering that I can manage and run my phone’s apps directly from my laptop. Overall, I gained a clearer view of how Android projects are structured and how each part works together in the app.
